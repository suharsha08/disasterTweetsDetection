FirstLoad the folder(from github) containing dataset and ipynb file into jupyternotebook

Run the cells in Jupyter notebook, which has the commands for installing necessary packages as well.

After running all cells at the end you see a local host port that can run streamlit app something like "http://localhost:8501"

Go to that link you see the streamlit app running, You can give tweets from the test dataset or anything random and it will predict whether the tweet is disaster tweet or not.
